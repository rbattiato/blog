Hi, my name is Riccardo Battiato. I've been working on the web professionally since 2019, and unprofessionally since 2012 when I made my first website. I'm passionate about frontend development, technology and philosophy.

This blog is a place to experiment, learn and share projects, ideas and my thoughts about everything I'm passionate about.  
You can contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_rbattiato) or sending an email to [mail@battiato.dev](mailto:mail@battiato.dev).
